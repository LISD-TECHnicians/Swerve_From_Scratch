# Swerve_From_Scratch

No additional swerve libraries to construct the swerve drive. We are figuring out swerve kinematics and odometry, PathPlanner, RPi camera, Elastic, Pose Estimation, and Object Detection. The pneumatic subysystem was added to teach new people and since the base plate of the bot could possibly become a trainer or test bed in the future.

PathPlanner, Pose Estimation, and Object Detection still need to be completed. PathPlanner needs Rio and VS Code to be updated to newest version. Pose Estimation can be worked on with the fmap file found in the limelight folder. Object detection needs to be researched and started with the Google Coral USB Accelerator.
