# Swerve_From_Scratch

No additional swerve libraries to construct the swerve drive. We are figuring out swerve kinematics and odometry, PathPlanner, RPi camera, Elastic, and localization. The pneumatic subysystem was added to teach new people and since the base plate of the  build will likely become a trainer in the future.

Currently, everything except for PathPlanner and localization are functional.
