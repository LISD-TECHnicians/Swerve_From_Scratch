# Swerve_From_Scratch

No additional swerve libraries to construct the swerve drive. We are figuring out swerve kinematics and odometry, PathPlanner, RPi camera, Elastic, Pose Estimation, and Object Detection. The pneumatic subysystem was added to teach new people and since the base plate of the bot could possibly become a trainer or test bed in the future.

PathPlanner, Pose Estimation, and Object Detection  still need to be completed, and are listed in oreder of priority. PathPlanner needs to be focused on and tested to get it functional, test code is written and everything for it is updated. Pose Estimation can be worked on with the fmap file found in the limelight folder. Object detection needs to be researched and started with the Google Coral USB Accelerator. Depending on when the dive into object detection starts we might need to test with last years detection files for cones and cubes from the Limelight downloads page.
