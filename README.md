# Swerve_From_Scratch

No additional swerve libraries to construct the swerve drive. We are figuring out swerve kinematics and odometry, PathPlanner, RPi camera, Elastic, Pose Estimation, and Object Detection. The pneumatic subysystem was added to teach new people and since the base plate of the bot could possibly become a trainer or test bed in the future.

All listed features function with this code, as long as setup external to this code is done correctly. Such as the Limelight pipelines being setup for this code.
