# Swerve_From_Scratch

No additional swerve libraries to construct the swerve drive. We are figuring out swerve kinematics and odometry, PathPlanner, RPi camera, Elastic, and localization. The pneumatic subysystem was added to teach new people and since the base plate of the  build will likely become a trainer in the future.

At the point where kinematics and odometry are working. Currently testing PathPlanner and working on setting up the RPi Camera. Aiming to have working PathPlanner by 1/12.
